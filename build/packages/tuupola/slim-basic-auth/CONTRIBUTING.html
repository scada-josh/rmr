<h2 id="only-one-feature-or-change-per-pull-request">Only one feature or change per pull request</h2>

<p>Make pull requests only one feature or change at the time. Make pull requests from feature branch. Pull requests should not come from your master branch.</p>

<p>For example you have fixed a bug. You also have optimized some code. Optimization is not related to a bug. These should be submitted as separate pull requests. This way I can easily choose what to include. It is also easier to understand the code changes.</p>

<h2 id="write-meaningful-commit-messages">Write meaningful commit messages</h2>

<p>Proper commit message is full sentence. It starts with capital letter but does not end with period. Headlines do not end with period. The GitHub default <code>Update filename.js</code> is not enough. When needed include also longer explanation what the commit does.</p>

<p>```
Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary</p>

<p>More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.
```</p>

<p>When in doubt see Tim Pope's blogpost <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">A Note About Git Commit Messages</a></p>

<h2 id="send-coherent-history">Send coherent history</h2>

<p>Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-existing-coding-standards">Follow the existing coding standards</h2>

<p>When contributing to open source project it is polite to follow the original authors coding standars. They might be different than yours. It is not a holy war. This project uses <strong><a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md">PSR-2 Coding Standard</a></strong></p>

<h2 id="running-tests">Running Tests</h2>

<p>You can run tests either manually…</p>

<p><code>bash
$ vendor/bin/phpunit
$ vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=PSR2 src/ -p
</code></p>

<p>… or automatically on every code change.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ npm install
$ grunt watch
</code></p>
