<p># Cordova Hooks</p>

<p>This directory may contain scripts used to customize cordova commands. This
directory used to exist at <code>.cordova/hooks</code>, but has now been moved to the
project root. Any scripts you add to these directories will be executed before
and after the commands corresponding to the directory name. Useful for
integrating your own build systems or integrating with version control systems.</p>

<p><strong>Remember</strong>: Make your scripts executable.</p>

<h2 id="hook-directories">Hook Directories</h2>
<p>The following subdirectories will be used for hooks:</p>

<pre><code>after_build/
after_compile/
after_docs/
after_emulate/
after_platform_add/
after_platform_rm/
after_platform_ls/
after_plugin_add/
after_plugin_ls/
after_plugin_rm/
after_plugin_search/
after_prepare/
after_run/
after_serve/
before_build/
before_compile/
before_docs/
before_emulate/
before_platform_add/
before_platform_rm/
before_platform_ls/
before_plugin_add/
before_plugin_ls/
before_plugin_rm/
before_plugin_search/
before_prepare/
before_run/
before_serve/
pre_package/ &lt;-- Windows 8 and Windows Phone only.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="script-interface">Script Interface</h2>

<p>All scripts are run from the project's root directory and have the root directory passes as the first argument. All other options are passed to the script using environment variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CORDOVA_VERSION - The version of the Cordova-CLI.</li>
  <li>CORDOVA_PLATFORMS - Comma separated list of platforms that the command applies to (e.g.: android, ios).</li>
  <li>CORDOVA_PLUGINS - Comma separated list of plugin IDs that the command applies to (e.g.: org.apache.cordova.file, org.apache.cordova.file-transfer)</li>
  <li>CORDOVA_HOOK - Path to the hook that is being executed.</li>
  <li>CORDOVA_CMDLINE - The exact command-line arguments passed to cordova (e.g.: cordova run ios â€“emulate)</li>
</ul>

<p>If a script returns a non-zero exit code, then the parent cordova command will be aborted.</p>

<h2 id="writing-hooks">Writing hooks</h2>

<p>We highly recommend writting your hooks using Node.js so that they are
cross-platform. Some good examples are shown here:</p>
