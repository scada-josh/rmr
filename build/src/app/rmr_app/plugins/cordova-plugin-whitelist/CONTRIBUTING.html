<h1 id="contributing-to-apache-cordova">Contributing to Apache Cordova</h1>

<p>Anyone can contribute to Cordova. And we need your contributions.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to contribute: report bugs, improve the docs, and
contribute code.</p>

<p>For instructions on this, start with the
<a href="http://cordova.apache.org/#contribute">contribution overview</a>.</p>

<p>The details are explained there, but the important items are:
 - Sign and submit an Apache ICLA (Contributor License Agreement).
 - Have a Jira issue open that corresponds to your contribution.
 - Run the tests so your patch doesn't break existing functionality.</p>

<p>We look forward to your contributions!</p>
